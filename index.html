            <h1> Avengers: Endgame</h1>
            <p>Director Joe Russo explains why they chose Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) to die in Avengers: Endgame and
                not Captain America (Chris Evans). Joe and his brother, Anthony, entered the MCU back in Phase 2 with
                the political thriller, Captain America: The Winter Soldier. After the success of their second Marvel
                Studios collaboration, Captain America: Civil War, the pair was brought on to wrap up the Infinity Saga
                with Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame, which was no walk in the park. Luckily, all their
                hard work paid off as both films became critical and commercial successes.

                Aside from properly introducing Thanos (Josh Brolin) and then culminating Marvel Studios' decade-long
                narrative, the Russos were also tasked with coming up with the best way to send off some of the MCU's
                founding heroes. That included the Avengers' co-leaders, Tony Stark and Steve Rogers. Now, the
                characters are both retired in the franchise, although their respective stories ended differently in
                Avengers: Endgame. Iron Man died by sacrificing his life to defeat the Mad Titan. Meanwhile, Captain
                America was given a second chance at life as he went back in time to reunite with Peggy Carter (Hayley
                Atwell) in the '40s.

            <p>A native of the planet Titan, Thanos saw the danger his people were in from overpopulation and
                suggested a severe solutionâ€”the elimination of half the population, at random and without prejudice,
